# In this part of the lesson we are goong to talk about Function 
# Function or functions are used to do specific things

# This is Function that takes in two numbers and adds it together
def add(a,b): 
    # Prints out the result
    print(a+b) 

# Another way to do the same thing
def add(a,b): 
    c = a + b # variable c holds your answer 
    print(c) # print value in c


# Another way to do the same thing
def add(a,b): 
    return a + b # This returns value but it does not print. :hint put the method in print
    

def subtract(a,b):
    #  Todo: Subtract two numbers and add it to 
    pass # Replace the pass with your code.


def multiply(a,b):
    #  Todo: Multiply two numbers and add it to 
    pass # Replace the pass with your code.

def divide(a,b):
    #  Todo: Divide two numbers and add it to 
    pass # Replace the pass with your code.


# Call and print out the numbers
add(90, 10)

#  Todo
subtract(4,9)
# Do the same for the remaining Function
