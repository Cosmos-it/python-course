# How print things using python:

print("This is my first day of Data Science and learning python as well")

# To test this program, open your terminal under the directory you wrote the program and 
# run: python main.py
# You should see something printed out.
# You might ask why does it have '.py' at the end, the reason is that python needs to know how to 
# process the file you created. This is enough for now.

print(number > 3) # Returns true if number is greater than 3
print(number < 3) # Return false
print(number % 10) # Returns the reminder of the number 0 or 1: 0 means the number divides evenly but not 1

# Variables:
# In programming, it is used for storing a value in the memory so that it can be used or reused.
# For instance, in python you can just do: 

myName = "Michelle Obama" # The name on the right is stored on the variable on the left
print(myName) # This will print out 'Michelle Obama'
thousand = 1000
print(thousand)
thousand = 1000.0 # This will override the value. 
print(thousand)
