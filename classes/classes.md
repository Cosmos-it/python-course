Class Definition in python. 

Terminologies 

- abstraction.
- instance.
- behaviors. 
- blueprint

- Class in OOP, is primarily used for abstraction. 

- In python, each piece of data is represented as an instance of a class. 
A python class has behaviors in the form of member functions (also known as method)

- A class serves as a blueprint for instance. This determines how state information such
as attributes represented (aka fields, variables, instance, and data instances) 

Immutable built classes
-----------------------
A class is said to be immutable if the class has fixed values upon instantiation. 

Example of these are are python' built-in class

- bool: Boolean value
- float: floating point number
- int: integer
- tuple: immutable sequence of objects
- str: character string
- fronzenset: immutable form of set class 

Mutable built-in classes 
------------------------

- list: mutable sequence of objects
- dict: associative mapping (dictionary)
- set: unordered set of distint objects

Key Operators in Python. 

- not: unary negation 
- and: conditional and 
- or conditional or 

Equality Operators 
- is same identity 
- is not different identity
- == equivalent 
- != not quivalent

bitwise Operators
∼ bitwise complement (prefix unary operator)
& bitwise and 
| bitwise or
ˆ bitwise exclusive-or
<< shift bits left, filling in with zeros 
>> shift bits right, filling in with sign bit

Input 

something = input("Enter something here!") 
# use split() function to get different characters
